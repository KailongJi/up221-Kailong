## Kailong Ji's Data Science Project Space

Hello, and welcome to my Data Science Project Space! I'm Kailong Ji, and this repository serves as a platform for documenting my journey into the fascinating world of data science.

### About Me

I am a graduate student in Civil Engineering with a concentration in Transportation. My hope is to use Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to extract valuable insights from spatial data, thereby contributing to a smarter, more sustainable transportation system.

### Learning Objectives

My primary objectives for Data Science Space are:

1. **Project Exploration:** To understand and gain knowledge about Data Science Space. Improve my problem-solving skills by applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios in conjunction with various data science projects.
   
2. **Skill Development:** Improve my skills in various data science tools and techniques such as Python, Jupyter Notebooks and machine learning frameworks.
   
3. **Collaboration:** Collaborate with team members and help each other to complete group projects.

### Learning Goals

Throughout the duration of the program, my goals were to

- Proficiency in Geographic Information System (GIS) technology.
- Have a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms and their applications.
- Create meaningful visualizations to effectively communicate insights.
- Collaborate with others in the data science community to broaden perspectives and share knowledge.
